Today, London is an industry leader, a melting pot of culinary talents and international gastronomy – influenced in no small part by Gustau's restaurant, which has encouraged discerning dining and attracted internationally renowned chefs to its kitchen.\n\nGustau's restaurant maintains the very highest of standards, with a sense of unremitting concentration and effortless attention to the needs of the clients, who are immediately made to feel at home by the team.",
